This is the first blog post to test that the blogging system for plated 
is setup and functioning. It was written on the morning of the first 
day of 2017.

So far we have cascading chunk system setup and working along with a 
simple plugin management which contains a blog plugin for doing blog type 
things. Organising a bunch of posts by time and displaying multiple 
posts on index pages.

I'm not bothering to break the blog system down even further into a 
list system, I figure that should just be a separate thing and should 
be built to deal with needs rather than trying to be ultra generic.

As it is I think we have enough bits working now that this can replace 
the static site generation in d-portal, which is where this JavaScript 
code came from originally. Will have to do some tests and see how it 
all goes.

Right now we are also available on NPM but probably a good idea to wait 
a little while for things to settle down as everything is still in a 
state of flux design wise as I try and take the design lessons from the 
old code and attempt to unify it into something simple.
