Having attempted to use plated under https://git-for-windows.github.io/ 
which is currently my goto way of dealing with linuxy stuff on windows. 
I hit a little problem.

It seems mingw, the thing that runs bash that makes git for windows 
viable gets a little bit carried away when you pass paths starting with 
/ into a command. Or set an environment variable, yeah tried that one.

http://www.mingw.org/wiki/Posix_path_conversion

It tends to replace / with wherever msys was installed to, probably a 
horrible path on yout c:\\ drive somewhere.

This is a bit of a problem if you are passing in a url to a static 
website builder. The current setup ended up replacing all the urls with 
links to my C: drive which is a tad inconvenient.

So I over solved it, a bit of messing around and it is now setup where 
if you do not provide a root for the site then we work it out as a 
relative path. So for instance if you are a couple of directories down 
then it would set the _root to ../../ which gets you there from the 
current page. This allows us to include js files or css files from the 
root using a relative path.

This works both for site that are built to the root of a domain and 
github style sites that get placed inside a sub directory. This can 
still be replaced with a --root=/whatever/ on the commandline but that 
wont work too well on the windows, but then again, what does?
