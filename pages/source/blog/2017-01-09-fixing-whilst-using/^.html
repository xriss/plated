Let's just call this a very mild alpha version of the plated^ system.
I've been using it for under an hour, trying to break things (which it
did within the first 10 minutes) but things are moving along and we're
already seeing places to fix and move around.

So far, this is rather a lot different from the previous iterations, ie.
Pagecake and Bootstrapp, but the changes are improvements suited to fit
the needs of all those years of use and this can only be a good thing.
